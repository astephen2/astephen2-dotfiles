# Solarized

Solarized is a color scheme created by [Ethan Schoonover](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). There are versions for pretty much every editor out there, available through [Github](https://github.com/altercation/solarized).

## Solarized for Sublime Text

This theme is created for Sublime Text (2 and 3). The versions of Solarized avaiable in the default installation use incorrect colors, due to being ported from another editor. The versions available in this package however were created especially for Sublime and the syntax grammars available for Sublime.

To install it, use Sublime Package Control following [these instructions](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation).
