![iTerm Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astephen2/dotfiles/master/docs/dotfiles.png)

These are the dotfiles that I use on my personal machine. The goal of this repo is to create a completely automated process to setup a new machine with my settings and applications.

## How To Run

Simply run bootstrap/install.sh and follow the instructions! Or go into bootstrap/lib and run parts individually

## Local Files

The following local files can exist in $DOTFILES/local. They will not be committed to git.

* path.bash: all path alterations
* .localrc - any zshrc customizations for this machine only.
* bin/ - any binaries for just this machine
